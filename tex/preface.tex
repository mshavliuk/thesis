The initial goal of this thesis was rather broad: to gain practical experience with transformer models applied to healthcare data while exploring innovative possibilities based on existing research and my own ideas. By my own measure, this goal has been achieved with great success. The unending optimizations of tensor computations, orchestration of a multitude of cluster nodes, and overall refinement of code design were truly entertaining and provided me with invaluable experience in practical problem-solving. I enjoyed learning a wide range of new technologies and expanding my data science toolkit.
